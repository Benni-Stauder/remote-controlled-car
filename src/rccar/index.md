# RC Auto Software

## Unittests

The Unittests are designed to evaluate all logic containing functions inside the rccar class and therfor test the functionality of the code
The downside of using Raspberry Pi propretary software is, that those unittests must be run on hardware, that support GPIO.
Because of this the unittest currently must be run on your own Pi or via a github runner using CI/CD
